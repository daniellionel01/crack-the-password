# Crack the password

Solving a puzzle I found on twitter: https://twitter.com/klip_ent/status/1768378677983875500

Here are the rules written down:

- [6][8][2] one number is correct and well placed
- [6][1][4] one number is correct but wrongly placed
- [2][0][6] two numbers are correct, but wrongly placed
- [7][3][8] nothing is correct
- [7][8][0] one number is correct, but wrongly placed
